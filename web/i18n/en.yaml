explainerText:
  other: DeepCausality is a hyper-geometric computational causality library that enables fast and deterministic context-aware causal reasoning. Deep causality offers multiple benefits such as fast reasoning, low-cost operations due to low computational requirements, analyzing numerous data feeds in real-time, and even reasoning across data that change over time, space, and spacetime through an adjustable context.
