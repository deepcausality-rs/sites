## What is DeepCausality?

DeepCausality is a hyper-geometric computational causality library that enables fast and deterministic context aware
causal reasoning over complex multi-stage causality models. Deep Causality adds only minimal overheads, and thus is
suitable for real-time applications without additional acceleration hardware.

Examples where DeepCausality can be used include dynamic control systems in the IoT industry, dynamic monitoring systems
in the cloud industry, and dynamic market models in the financial industry. Start-ups aiming to disrupt existing
industries may also explore DeepCausality to gain a competitive edge.

See the [documentation for more](/docs/intro/) and check the [blog for latest updates](/blog/).

## Linux Foundation

DeepCausality is hosted as a sandbox project at
the [Linux Foundation for data and artificial intelligence](https://lfaidata.foundation/).
The Linux Foundation is the world’s leading home for collaboration on open source software, hardware, standards, and
data. Linux Foundation projects are critical to the world’s infrastructure including Linux, Kubernetes, Node.js, ONAP,
RISC-V, SPDX, OpenChain, and more. The Linux Foundation focuses on advancing best practices and addressing the needs of
contributors, users, and solution providers to create sustainable models for open collaboration. For more information,
please visit  [linuxfoundation.org](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

## No Cookie & Do Not Track Policy

The DeepCausality project deliberately chose user privacy and decided against invasive analytics and tracking.
Therefore, the DeepCausality.com website:

* Does not use cookies (Verified with [cookieserve.com](https://www.cookieserve.com/))
* Does not use Google Analytics or any other form of user tracking (Verified
  with [SEO Site Checkup](https://seositecheckup.com/analysis))
* Does not use any [web beacons or tracker pixels[1]](https://bluebirdinternational.com/web-beacons/)

Furthermore, the full source code of the DeepCausality.com website
is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/sites).
If you find any violation of this no cookie & no tracking policy,
please [open an issue of GitHub](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/sites/issues)
and [contact us immediately](/contact/).

[1] Web beacons and tracker pixels are really hard to detect, but are problematic since
they [can be used in phishing attacks](https://securityboulevard.com/2023/04/web-beacons-how-to-effectively-use-them-for-phishing-detection/).
Please enable the "Do Not Track" option in your browser settings to stop tracking by default.
