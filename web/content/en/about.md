## DeepCausality

DeepCausality is a hyper-geometric computational causality library that enables fast and deterministic context aware
causal reasoning over complex multi-stage causality models. Deep Causality adds only minimal overheads, and thus is
suitable for real-time applications without additional acceleration hardware. See
the [documentation for more](/docs/intro/).

## Linux Foundation

DeepCausality is hosted as a sandbox project at
the [Linux Foundation for data and artificial intelligence](https://lfaidata.foundation/).
The Linux Foundation is the world’s leading home for collaboration on open source software, hardware, standards, and
data. Linux Foundation projects are critical to the world’s infrastructure including Linux, Kubernetes, Node.js, ONAP,
RISC-V, SPDX, OpenChain, and more. The Linux Foundation focuses on advancing best practices and addressing the needs of
contributors, users, and solution providers to create sustainable models for open collaboration. For more information,
