## Overview

We are thrilled to announce the release of `deep_causality_physics`, a new crate designed to accelerate complex physics simulations, advanced engineering, and scientific computing in Rust.

While Rust has an exploding ecosystem for linear algebra (`ndarray`, `nalgebra`) and game physics (`rapier`), there has been a gap in high-fidelity **theoretical physics**. We built `deep_causality_physics` to fill this gap, providing a comprehensive collection of kernels spanning from Quantum Mechanics to General Relativity.

## 🏗️ The Foundation: Uniform Mathematics

Scientific computing is often fragmented. You use one library for Tensors, another for Geometric Algebra, and a third for Topology. Connecting them requires writing brittle "glue code" that swallows errors and hides physical meaning.

This crate is built on the **[Uniform Mathematical Foundation](announcement-uniform-math.md)** introduced in DeepCausality. Powered by our **[Higher-Order Abstract Functional Traits (HAFT)](announcement-haft-hkt.md)**, it treats Tensors, MultiVectors, and Topological Manifolds as composable, monadic structures.

This means you can take a **Tensor** representing a gravitational field, map it into a **MultiVector** to compute electromagnetic interactions, and project the result onto a **Topological Manifold** all within a single, type-safe, and mathematically rigorous flow.

## 📦 Modular Architecture

The library is organized into modular domains, each providing highly optimized computation kernels:

*   **🌌 Astro**: Schwarzschild radius, orbital mechanics, Hubble's law.
*   **⚛️ Quantum**: Wavefunctions, operators, gates, fidelity, and Haruna's Gauge Field gates.
*   **🕰️ Relativity**: Einstein tensors, geodesic deviation, spacetime intervals.
*   **⚡ Electromagnetism**: Maxwell's equations, Lorentz force, Poynting vectors using Geometric Algebra.
*   **🔥 Thermodynamics**: Heat diffusion, entropy, partition functions.
*   **🧱 Materials**: Stress/Strain tensors, Hooke's Law, Von Mises stress.
*   **📏 Units**: A rigorous type-safe unit system to prevent dimensional errors.

## ⚡ Dual Usage: Standalone or Causal

We designed this crate to be versatile. You can use it in two distinct ways:

### 1. Standalone (Pure Rust)
If you just need to calculate a value, use the **Kernels**. These are pure, stateless functions that take primitive types or tensors and return a `Result`.

```rust
use deep_causality_physics::astro::mechanics::schwarzschild_radius_kernel;
use deep_causality_physics::Mass;

let mass = Mass::new(1.989e30).unwrap(); // Solar mass
let radius = schwarzschild_radius_kernel(&mass).unwrap();
println!("Schwarzschild Radius: {} m", radius.value());
```

### 2. Causal (Monadic Simulation)
If you are building a complex simulation with state, logging, and error propagation, use the **Wrappers**. These lift the kernels into the **Causal Monad** (`PropagatingEffect`), allowing you to chain physics operations into a pipeline.

```rust
use deep_causality_physics::schwarzschild_radius;

// Returns a PropagatingEffect that carries audit logs and error context
let effect = schwarzschild_radius(&mass)
    .bind(|r, _, _| {
        // ... chain next step ...
    });
```

## 🧪 Case Study: Multi-Physics Pipeline

To demonstrate the power of this approach, we included a **[Multi-Physics Pipeline example](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/deep_causality/tree/main/examples/physics_examples/examples/multi_physics_pipeline)** in the repository.

This example simulates the decay of a Higgs-like particle, requiring **zero-copy data transformation** across three distinct branches of physics:

1.  **Quantum Field Theory**: It starts with a scalar field $\phi$ evolving on a Topological Manifold via the **Klein-Gordon equation**.
2.  **Particle Physics**: As energy density spikes, it triggers **Hadronization**, converting field energy into discrete momentum vectors (Jets).
3.  **Thermodynamics**: The particle jets thermalize, and we solve the **Heat Diffusion** equation to model the expansion of the resulting quark-gluon plasma.
4.  **Quantum Measurement**: Finally, we calculate the **Born Probability** of detecting specific final states.

```rust
// A simplified view of the pipeline
let result = klein_gordon(&phi_manifold, mass)
    .bind_or_error(
        |evolved_tensor, _, _| hadronization(&evolved_tensor, ...),
        "Hadronization failed"
    )
    .bind_or_error(
        |jets, _, _| heat_diffusion(&jets, ...),
        "Thermalization failed"
    )
    .bind_or_error(
        |final_temp, _, _| born_probability(&final_temp, ...),
        "Detection failed"
    );
```

In a traditional setup, passing data from a QFT solver to a Fluid Dynamics solver would involve writing files to disk or complex memory mapping. Here, because Tensors and Manifolds share the same **HKT** foundation, the data flows seamlessly through the pipeline.
