The DeepCausality project has published the ["Effect Propagation Process" (EPP)](/docs/philosophy/), a philosophical framework that informs its Rust implementation. The EPP offers a unified philosophical framework of causality that remains compatible with classical causality and conceptually congruent with physics theories of quantum gravity. Read more in the [documentation](/docs/philosophy/).

Furthermore, a new [articles section](https://deepcausality.com/papers/) was added to the project website 
to provide easy access to PDF versions of all articles written by the DeepCausality project. 

Lastly, a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/deepcausality-rs/papers) for all articles published on the website has been created to host all source files (i.e. Markdown and Latex) that were used for an article.
