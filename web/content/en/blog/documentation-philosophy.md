The DeepCausality project has published the "Effect Propagation Process" (EPP), a philosophical framework for Post-Quantum Causality that informs its Rust implementation. The EPP offers a unified philosophical framework of causality that remains compatible with classical causality and conceptually congruent with physics theories of quantum gravity.
