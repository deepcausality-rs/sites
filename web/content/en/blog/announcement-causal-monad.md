## Overview

We are excited to introduce the **Causal Monad**, a powerful new core feature in DeepCausality that radically simplifies how you write complex causal logic.

If you have ever built a complex data processing pipeline, you know the pain: you start with a simple value, but soon you are juggling error handling, audit logging, configuration contexts, and mutable state across a dozen function calls buried under boilerplate.

The Causal Monad solves this by abstracting away the plumbing. It allows you to chain causal operations together while automatically handling:

*   **Error Propagation**: Like Rust's `Result`, it short-circuits on failure.
*   **Audit Logging**: Every step is automatically recorded for explainability.
*   **Context & State**: Configuration and state are carried through the chain implicitly.

## 💡 The Problem: Boilerplate Overload

Imagine you are building a system to monitor engine temperature. You need to:
1.  Read the sensor.
2.  Validate the reading.
3.  Check if it exceeds a threshold (from a config context).
4.  Update a moving average (state).
5.  Log every step for debugging.

Without a monad, your function signatures become messy, constantly passing around `&Config`, `&mut State`, and `&mut Vec<Log>`. You also have to manually check `if result.is_err() { return ... }` at every step.

## ⚡ The Solution: `PropagatingEffect` and `PropagatingProcess`

DeepCausality provides two key types to clean this up, functioning very similar to Rust's standard `Option` and `Result` types.

### 1. Stateless Logic: `PropagatingEffect`

For pure logic where you don't need to maintain state between steps, use `PropagatingEffect`. It behaves like a supercharged `Result` type that keeps a log of what happened.

```rust
use deep_causality_core::{PropagatingEffect, EffectValue};

fn main() {
    // Start with a value
    let result = PropagatingEffect::pure(10)
        // Chain a calculation. 
        // bind passes: (value, state, context)
        .bind(|val, _, _| {
            // Unpack the EffectValue (similar to Option::unwrap)
            let v = val.into_value().expect("Expected a value");
            PropagatingEffect::pure(v + 5) 
        })
        // Chain another step
        .bind(|val, _, _| {
            let v = val.into_value().expect("Expected a value");
            
            if v > 20 {
                PropagatingEffect::pure(v)
            } else {
                 // Return an error (short-circuits future steps)
                 PropagatingEffect::from_error(
                     deep_causality_core::CausalityError::new(
                         deep_causality_core::CausalityErrorEnum::Custom("Value too low".into())
                     )
                 )
            }
        });
        
    // If an error occurred, result.error is set.
    // If successful, result.value contains the final data.
    // In ALL cases, result.logs contains the history.
}
```

### 2. Stateful Logic: `PropagatingProcess`

For Markovian processes where you need to track state (like a running counter or risk score) and access configuration, use `PropagatingProcess`.

```rust
use deep_causality_core::PropagatingProcess;

// Your custom state
#[derive(Clone, Default)]
struct SystemState {
    counter: i32,
}

// Your custom configuration
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Config {
    threshold: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let initial_val = 10;
    let state = SystemState::default();
    let config = Config { threshold: 100 };

    // Initialize the process
    let process = PropagatingProcess::with_state(
        deep_causality_core::PropagatingEffect::pure(initial_val),
        state,
        Some(config)
    );

    let final_process = process.bind(|val, mut current_state, ctx| {
        // We have access to:
        // val: The EffectValue from the previous step
        // current_state: The accumulated state
        // ctx: The read-only configuration
        
        let v = val.into_value().expect("Value expected");
        current_state.counter += 1;
        
        // Return the new value, potentially modified state, and pass context through
        deep_causality_core::CausalEffectPropagationProcess {
            value: deep_causality_core::EffectValue::Value(v * 2),
            state: current_state,
            context: ctx,
            error: None,
            logs: Default::default(), // Logs are merged automatically
        }
    });
}
```

## 🛠️ Mission-Critical Safety: `ControlFlowBuilder`

While the monadic approach offers flexibility, some systems—like flight control or medical devices—require absolute, compile-time guarantees. For these use cases, we introduced the **ControlFlowBuilder**.

This tool allows you to define a **static execution graph** where:
*   Connections are verified at compile-time (Output Type `A` must match Input Type `A`).
*   Execution is zero-allocation (in the hot loop).
*   Logic can be restricted to stateless functions for formal verification.

```rust
use deep_causality_core::ControlFlowBuilder;

// Define a type-safe graph builder
let mut builder = ControlFlowBuilder::<MyProtocol>::default();

// Add nodes (functions)
let sensor = builder.add_node(read_sensor);
let filter = builder.add_node(filter_noise);

// Connect them (compiler checks types!)
builder.connect(sensor, filter);

// Build an optimized executable graph
let graph = builder.build();
```

## Conclusion

The Causal Monad brings the elegance of functional programming to causal inference. By treating causality as a computation chain that implicitly carries state, context, and logs, DeepCausality allows you to write code that is clean, readable, and incredibly robust.
